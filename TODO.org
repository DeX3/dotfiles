* Projects

Set up a better project system to not accidentally "fall" to other
projects when killing buffers
* Macros
** my/edit-evil-macro

A command that can edit any evil using `kmacro-edit-macro`. See this
for some pointers: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22817120/how-can-i-save-evil-mode-vim-style-macros-to-my-init-el/22820324


* Bugs

** Macro recording bug

Recording a macro that contains `c w` will record the `w` twice (view
the last recorded macro using `kmacro-edit-macro`).

** Cannot cancel `kmacro-edit-macro` with evil

Is normally cancelled with `C-x k RET` but that doesn't work with evil.
** fci-mode bug

fci-mode causes some visual glitches with company and also sometimes
fucks up editing. Find a better alternative. Also, there's a problem
with that package that shows the current indentation level with `|`s


** Cannot always repeat indentation command made in visual mode

Example:
1) Paste some text
2) Use `g p` to visually select pasted text
3) Press `> >` to indent the text once
4) Press `.` to repeat indentation of pasted text -> doesn't work
